Did you ever feel the urge to create ?    \r\nThan this might be something for you.\r\n\r\nThis Workshop will make you understand [Blender](http://blender.org) and   \r\ncreate designs suitable for a 3D printer. Through 12 hours of lessons   \r\nwe will teach you how to use the Blender User Interface effectively.   \r\nUnderstand the tools specially designed to aid you, like the [3D Printing Toolbox](http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts/Modeling/PrintToolbox).  \r\nYou will learn how to scann objects, make alterations, check parameter  \r\nthresholds, overcome boundaries and embrace the essence of this technology.  \r\nFinally print your designed objects on one of our 3D printers and process   \r\nyour newly acquired skills into action.   \r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@morriswinkler\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\ncontact info@open3dengineering.organd weâ€™ll help you sort it out.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
