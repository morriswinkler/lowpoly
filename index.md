##Open Design for 3D printing.

A Workshop for the 3D printing enthusiast.  

### Overview

Did you ever wonder how 3D printers work and how you could design objects   
suitable for printing ? Did you ever feel the urge to create ?    
Than this might be something for you.

This Workshop will make you understand [Blender](http://blender.org) and   
create designs suitable for a 3D printer. Through 12 hours of lessons   
we will teach you how to use the Blender User Interface effectively.   
Understand the tools specially designed to aid you, like the [3D Printing Toolbox](http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts/Modeling/PrintToolbox).  
You will learn how to scann objects, make alterations, check parameter  
thresholds, overcome boundaries and embrace the essence of this technology.  
Finally print your designed objects on one of our 3D printers and process   
your newly acquired skills into action.
